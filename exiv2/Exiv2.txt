Exiv2 Speaker's Notes
---------------------

1) What is Exiv2?
-----------------

Exiv2 is a Cross-platform C++ library and a command line utility to manage image metadata.

Exiv2 provides fast and easy read and write access to the Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata
and the ICC Profile embedded within digital images in various formats.

Exiv2 is used in many projects including KDE and Gnome Desktops as well as many applications
including GIMP, darktable, shotwell, GwenView and Luminance HDR.

2) Contributor and Roadmap
--------------------------

Project was started in 2004 by Andreas Huggel

Robin joined in 2008 and carried it alone from 2012-2017

Delighted to say the team is growing steadily
and we have friends (in other projects) who help and encourage.

Releases
--------
Exiv2 v0.27 was released in December 2018

We are planning a series of "dot" releases in 2019 and 2020
while the code is refactored for C++11.

v0.28 is more than refactoring, it's a major internal overhaul.

Exiv2 hopes to release v0.28 in 2020
