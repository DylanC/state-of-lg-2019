# PhotoFlare (speaker's notes)

-- Main GUI --

PhotoFlare is an Open-Source image editor distributed under the GPL license. It is fully Cross Platform software and has been translated into five world languages, thanks to the wonderful community of users. Technology wise the editor is built upon Qt5, C++ and GraphicsMagick.

Last year we released eight bug fix releases to the v1.5 series of the project. We got Travis CI and automatic AppImage builds setup on GitHub to help the project thanks to the developer community. This year our project pushed out two more bug fix releases (v1.5.7, v1.5.8). We got featured in a podcast ([linuxgamecast.com](https://linuxgamecast.com/2018/12/lwdw-147-linux-in-2019/)) and online magazine ([libregraphicsworld.org](http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/photoflare-interview-2019)). The stable v1.5 series has been accepted into Debian repositories and is available since Ubuntu 19.04 as an [official package](https://packages.ubuntu.com/source/disco/photoflare).

I have started to do some dedicated development days inside an office environment outside of my day job in order to progress the next major iteration (v2.0). In v2.0 we hope to push this project even further with features such as Layer support and LibMyPaint brushes. PhotoFlare v1.5.x continues to become available in [more repositories](https://repology.org/project/photoflare/versions) within Linux distributions. To keep this project in motion we would appreciate some donations, code contributions or new translations.
