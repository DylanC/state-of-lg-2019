Last year we released eight bug fix releases to the v1.5 series of the project. We got Travis CI and automatic AppImage builds setup on GitHub to help the project thanks to community contributions. This year our project pushed out two more bug fix releases (v1.5.7, v1.5.8). We got featured in a podcast (linuxgamecast.com) and online magazine (libregraphicsworld.org). The stable v1.5 series has been accepted into Debian repositories and is available since Ubuntu 19.04 as an official package.

I started to do some dedicated development days inside an office outside of my day job in order to progress the next major iteration. (v2.0)
